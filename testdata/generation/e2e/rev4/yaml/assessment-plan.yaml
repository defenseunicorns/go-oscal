                For now, FedRAMP recommends one of the following:

                * Render the OSCAL SAP signature page as a PDF that is digitally signed and attached.
                * Render the OSCAL SAP signature page as a printed page that is physically signed, scanned, and attached.


                If your organization prefers another approach, please seek prior approval from the FedRAMP PMO.

                Roles are described in the [CSO Name] SSP, Section 11, Separation of Duties. Additional roles that are being introduced as part of significant changes will be tested and are noted in Table D-1.

[IA Name] will access the system while logged in as different user types and attempt to perform restricted functions for that user.

            Link the SAP to the SSP.

            FedRAMP prefers the path for the SSP be relative to the location of this SAP file. Absolute links will likely not work when FedRAMP tools import the content.

            This may point to a back-matter resource using a URI fragment.

            If no OSCAL-based SSP exists, this must be a URI fragment pointing to a special back-matter resource. The resource must include the `no-oscal-ssp` conformity tag.

                The UUID assigned to the origional incorrect role in the SSP must be cited in the \"updates-uuid\" property.

                The SAP syntax duplicates the SSP user syntax.

                This local entry completely replaces the entry in the SSP.

                Tools should duplicate the entire assembly from the SSP to this location, then allow the assessor to add or change the details.

                This ensures the entry here is complete.

              remarks: |-
                The ID assigned to this missing role must not be used in the SSP user list.

                The SAP user assembly duplicates the SSP user assembly, which requires a role-id.

                If an existing role in the SSP is appropriate, reference it here.

                If no appropriate role exists in the SSP, the role-id may be left blank in the SAP.

                The party-uuid should observation-source a party in the SSP.

                If an appropriate party does not exist in the SSP, the SAP tool should add a party to the SAP, or have the CSP add the party to the SSP.

                The SAP tool should not modify the SSP.

                # Control Objective Scope

                Within the OSCAL-based FedRAMP baselines, FedRAMP has defined the control objectives for which an assessor must respond. Those must be explicityly listed here.

                This template only includes the AC-2(f) response points from the FedRAMP Moderate Baseline based on NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4.

                This is analgous to the individual rows listed in the empty FedRAMP Test Case Workbook ([Moderate](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SAP-AA-FedRAMP-Moderate-Security-Test-Case-Procedures-Template.xlsx)).

                Note that the specified objective-ids must exist in the referenced profile / catalog.
              include-objectives:
                - objective-id: ac-2.f_obj.1

                # Control Scope

                Initial assessments include all controls.

                Annual assessment include a subset of controls as defined by FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Guidance and any adjudicating officials.

                This example demonstrates including all controls identified in the SSP's baseline, and then explicilty excludes AC-1.

                FedRAMP is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud services. Security assessments are an integral part of the FedRAMP security authorization process.

                Cloud services must be assessed by an IA. The use of an IA reduces the potential for conflicts of interest that could occur in verifying the implementation status and effectiveness of the security controls.

                    This plan is for an annual assessment of [CSO Name], a [One: High/Moderate/ Low] baseline system. After the initial security assessment, FedRAMP requires that the system is assessed annually thereafter (12 months from an agency ATO / JAB P-ATO date). While the entire set of security controls is assessed during the initial assessment, a subset is assessed during the annual assessment. The control selection is in accordance with the criteria outlined in the [FedRAMP Annual Assessment Guidance](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Annual_Assessment_Guidance.pdf) and includes:

                    * Core controls (required annually)
                    * CSP-selected controls required to address system changes that have been implemented and/or changed by a CSP since their last assessment (this excludes those controls or portions of controls previously assessed under a significant change within the same annual period)
                    * Validation of Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&Ms) closed since the last assessment
                    * Validation of POA&Ms identified as vendor dependencies (VDs) or deviation requests (DRs)
                    * CSP-selected controls identified as “Not Applicable” (N/A) to validate they are, in fact, not applicable
                    * Controls that have not been assessed, at least once in a three year period, to ensure controls are meeting periodicity requirements
