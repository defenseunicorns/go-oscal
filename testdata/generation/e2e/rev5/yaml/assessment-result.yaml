              remarks: |-
                FedRAMP is formulating guidelines for handling digital/electronic signatures in OSCAL, and welcome feedback on solutions.

                For now, FedRAMP recommends one of the following:

                * Render the OSCAL SAR content as a PDF that is digitally signed and attached.
                * Render the OSCAL SAR content as printed pages that are physically signed, scanned, and attached.


                If your organization prefers another approach, please seek prior approval from the FedRAMP PMO.
