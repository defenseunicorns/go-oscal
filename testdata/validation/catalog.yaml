                        When embarking upon the design of a system, the type, value and security objectives for the system, based on confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements, should be determined. This will ultimately guide activities, such as selecting and tailoring controls, to meet those security objectives and determine the level of residual security risk that will be accepted before the system is authorised to operate.

                        Following the determination of the type and value of a system, along with its security objectives, a description of the system and its characteristics should be documented in the systemâ€™s system security plan.

                        Each cyber security guideline discusses security risks associated with the topics it covers. Paired with these discussions are controls that ASD considers to provide efficient and effective mitigations based on their suitability to achieve the security objectives for a system.

                        While security risks and controls are discussed in the cyber security guidelines, and act as a baseline, they should not be considered an exhaustive list for a specific system type or technology. As such, the cyber security guidelines provide an important input into an organisationâ€™s risk identification and risk treatment activities however do not represent the full extent of such activities.

                        While the cyber security guidelines can assist with risk identification and risk treatment activities, an organisation will still need to undertake their own risk analysis and risk evaluation activities due to the unique nature of each system, its operating environment and the organisationâ€™s risk tolerances.

                        Following the selection and tailoring of controls for a system, they should be recorded along with the details of their planned implementation in the systemâ€™s system security plan annex. In addition, and as appropriate, controls should also be recorded in both the systemâ€™s cyber security incident response plan and continuous monitoring plan.

                        Finally, the selection of controls for a system, as documented in the systemâ€™s system security plan annex, should be approved by the systemâ€™s authorising officer.

In doing so, the details of their actual implementation, if different from their planned implementation, should be documented in the systemâ€™s system security plan annex.

                        In conducting a security assessment, it is important that assessors and system owners first agree to the scope, type and extent of assessment activities, which may be documented in a security assessment plan, such that any risks associated with the security assessment can be appropriately managed. To a large extent, the scope of the security assessment will be determined by the type of system and controls that have been implemented for the system and its operating environment.

                        For TOP SECRET systems, including sensitive compartmented information systems, security assessments can be undertaken by ASD assessors (or their delegates). While for SECRET and below systems, security assessments can be undertaken by an organisationâ€™s own assessors or Infosec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) assessors. In all cases, assessors should hold an appropriate security clearance and have an appropriate level of experience and understanding of the type of system they are assessing.

                        At the conclusion of a security assessment, a security assessment report should be produced outlining the scope of the security assessment, the systemâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, security risks associated with the operation of the system, the effectiveness of the implementation of controls, and any recommended remediation actions. This will assist in performing any initial remediation actions as well as guiding the development of the systemâ€™s plan of action and milestones.

                        **Authorise the system to operate based on the acceptance of the security risks associated with its operation.**

                        Before a system can be granted authorisation to operate, sufficient information should be provided to the authorising officer in order for them to make an informed risk-based decision as to whether the security risks associated with its operation are acceptable or not. This information should take the form of an authorisation package that includes the systemâ€™s system security plan, cyber security incident response plan, continuous monitoring plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones.

                        In some cases, the security risks associated with a systemâ€™s operation will be acceptable and it will be granted an ongoing authorisation to operate. However, in other cases the security risks associated with the operation of a system may be unacceptable. In such cases, the authorising officer may request further work be undertaken by the system owner. In the intervening time, the authorising officer may choose to grant authorisation to operate but with constraints placed on the systemâ€™s use, such as limiting the systemâ€™s functionality or specifying an expiration date for authorisation to operate. Finally, if the authorising officer deems the security risks to be unacceptable, regardless of any potential constraints placed on the systemâ€™s use, they may deny authorisation to operate until such time that sufficient remediation actions, if possible, have been completed to an acceptable standard.

                        For TOP SECRET systems, and systems that process, store or communicate sensitive compartmented information, the authorising officer is Director-General ASD or their delegate; while for SECRET and below systems, the authorising officer is an organisationâ€™s CISO or their delegate.

                        For multinational and multi-organisation systems, the authorising officer should be determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved.

                        For commercial providers providing services to an organisation, the authorising officer is the CISO of the supported organisation or their delegate.

                        In all cases, the authorising officer should have an appropriate level of seniority and understanding of security risks they are accepting on behalf of their organisation. In cases where an organisation does not have a CISO, the authorising officer could be a Chief Security Officer, a Chief Information Officer or other senior executive within the organisation.

                        **Monitor the system, and associated cyber threats, security risks and controls, on an ongoing basis.**

                        Real-time monitoring of cyber threats, security risks and controls associated with a system and its operating environment, as outlined in a continuous monitoring plan, is essential to maintaining its security posture. In doing so, specific events may necessitate additional risk management activities. Such events may include:

                        - changes in security policies relating to the system
                        - detection of new or emerging cyber threats to the system or its operating environment
                        - the discovery that controls for the system are not as effective as planned
                        - a major cyber security incident involving the system
                        - major architectural changes to the system.

                        Following the implementation or modification of any controls as a result of risk management activities, another security assessment should be completed. In doing so, the systemâ€™s authorisation package should be updated. This in turn allows the authorising officer to make an informed risk-based decision as to whether the security risks associated with the systemâ€™s operation are still acceptable. Should security risks no longer be acceptable, the authorising officer may choose to either place constraints on the systemâ€™s use, such as introducing or amending an expiration date for authorisation to operate, or revoke authorisation to operate altogether.

                    # Purpose of the cyber security principles

                    The purpose of the cyber security principles is to provide strategic guidance on how an organisation can protect their systems and data from cyber threats. These cyber security principles are grouped into four key activities: govern, protect, detect and respond.

                    - **Govern:** Identifying and managing security risks.
                    - **Protect:** Implementing controls to reduce security risks.
                    - **Detect:** Detecting and understanding cyber security events to identify cyber security incidents.
                    - **Respond:** Responding to and recovering from cyber security incidents.

                    # Maturity modelling

                    When implementing the cyber security principles, an organisation can use the following maturity model to assess the implementation of individual principles, groups of principles or the cyber security principles as a whole. The five levels in the maturity model are:

                    - **Incomplete:** The cyber security principles are partially implemented or not implemented.
                    - **Initial:** The cyber security principles are implemented, but in a poor or ad hoc manner.
                    - **Developing:** The cyber security principles are sufficiently implemented, but on a project-by-project basis.
                    - **Managing:** The cyber security principles are established as standard business practices and robustly implemented throughout the organisation.
                    - **Optimising:** A deliberate focus on optimisation and continual improvement exists for the implementation of the cyber security principles throughout the organisation.

                    The role of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) requires a combination of technical and soft skills, such as business acumen, leadership, communications and relationship building. Additionally, a CISO must adopt a continuous approach to learning and up-skilling in order to maintain pace with the cyber threat landscape and new technologies. It is expected that a CISO show innovation and imagination in conceiving and delivering cyber security strategies for their organisation.

In doing so, a cyber security incident management policy will likely cover the following:

                        - responsibilities for planning for, detecting and responding to cyber security incidents
                        - resources assigned to cyber security incident planning, detection and response activities
                        - guidelines for triaging and responding to cyber security events and cyber security incidents.

                        Furthermore, as part of maintaining the cyber security incident management policy, it is important that it is, along with its associated cyber security incident response plan, exercised at least annually to ensure it remains fit for purpose.

                        As a trusted insiderâ€™s system access and knowledge of business processes often makes them harder to detect, establishing and maintaining a trusted insider program can assist an organisation to detect and respond to trusted insider threats before they occur, or limit damage if they do occur. In doing so, an organisation will likely obtain the most benefit by logging and analysing the following user activities:

                        - excessive copying or modification of files
                        - unauthorised or excessive use of removable media
                        - connecting devices capable of data storage to systems
                        - unusual system usage outside of normal business hours
                        - excessive data access or printing compared to their peers

                        The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) uses the cyber security incident reports it receives as the basis for providing assistance to organisations. Cyber security incident reports are also used by ASD to identify trends and maintain an accurate threat environment picture. ASD utilises this understanding to assist in the development of new and updated cyber security advice, capabilities, and techniques to better prevent and respond to evolving cyber threats. An organisation is recommended to internally coordinate their reporting of cyber security incidents to ASD.

                        The types of cyber security incidents that should be reported to ASD include:

                        - suspicious activities, such as privileged account lockouts and unusual remote access activities
                        - compromise of sensitive or classified data
                        - unauthorised access or attempts to access a system

                    # Cyber security events

                    A cyber security event is an occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a possible breach of security policy, failure of safeguards or a previously unknown situation that may be relevant to security.

                    # Cyber security incidents

                    A cyber security incident is an unwanted or unexpected cyber security event, or a series of such events, that has either compromised business operations or has a significant probability of compromising business operations.

                    # Cyber resilience

                    Cyber resilience is the ability to adapt to disruptions caused by cyber security incidents while maintaining continuous business operations. This includes the ability to detect, manage and recover from cyber security incidents.

                    # Detecting cyber security incidents

                    One of the core elements of detecting and investigating cyber security incidents is the availability of appropriate data sources, such as event logs. The following event logs can be used by an organisation to assist with detecting and investigating cyber security incidents:

                    - **Cross Domain Solutions:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Databases:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Domain Name System services:** May assist in identifying attempts to resolve malicious domain names or Internet Protocol addresses indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Email servers:** May assist in identifying users targeted with phishing emails thereby helping to identify the initial vector of a compromise.
                    - **Gateways:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Multifunction devices: May assist in**identifying anomalous or malicious user behaviour indicating a cyber security incident or malicious insider activity.
                    - **Operating systems:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious activity indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Remote access services:** May assist in identifying unusual locations of access or times of access indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Security services:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Server applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **System access:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **User applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Web applications:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious application or user behaviour indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.
                    - **Web proxies:** May assist in identifying anomalous or malicious network traffic indicating an exploitation attempt or successful compromise.

As a priority, all infected systems and media should be isolated to prevent the infection from spreading. Once isolated, infected systems and media can be scanned by antivirus software to potentially remove the infection or recover data. It is important to note though, a complete system restoration from a known good backup or rebuild may be the only reliable way to ensure that malicious code can be truly eradicated or data recovered.

                        When an intrusion is detected on a system, an organisation may wish to allow the intrusion to continue for a short period of time in order to fully understand the extent of the compromise and to assist with planning intrusion remediation activities. However, an organisation allowing an intrusion to continue in order to collect data or evidence should first establish with their legal advisors whether such activities would be breaching the [Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979](#e4c07309-9ca8-40b7-9571-4f6c032180a1).

                        To increase the likelihood of intrusion remediation activities successfully removing malicious actors from their system, an organisation can take preventative measures to ensure malicious actors have limited forewarning and awareness of planned intrusion remediation activities. Specifically, using an alternative system to plan and coordinate intrusion remediation activities will prevent alerting malicious actors if they have already compromised email, messaging or collaboration services. In addition, conducting intrusion remediation activities in a coordinated manner during the same planned outage will prevent forewarning malicious actors, thereby depriving them of sufficient time to establish alternative access points or persistence methods on the system.

                        Following intrusion remediation activities, an organisation should determine whether malicious actors have been successfully removed from the system, including whether or not they have since reacquired access. This can be achieved, in part, by capturing and analysing network traffic for at least seven days following remediation activities.

                        Cyber supply chain risk management activities should be conducted during the earliest possible stage of procurement of applications, ICT equipment and services. In particular, an organisation should consider the security risks that may arise as systems, software and hardware are being designed, built, stored, delivered, installed, operated, maintained and decommissioned. This includes identifying and managing jurisdictional, governance, privacy and security risks associated with the use of suppliers, such as application developers, ICT equipment manufacturers, service providers and other organisations involved in distribution channels. For example, outsourced cloud services may be located offshore and subject to lawful and covert data collection without their customersâ€™ knowledge. Additionally, use of offshore services introduces jurisdictional risks as foreign countriesâ€™ laws could change with little warning. Finally, foreign owned suppliers operating in Australia may be subject to a foreign governmentâ€™s lawful access to data belonging to their customers.

                        In managing cyber supply chain risks, it is important that an organisation preferences suppliers that have demonstrated a commitment to the security of their products and services â€“ including throughout distribution channels. In addition, suppliers should have a strong track record of transparency and maintaining the security of their own systems and cyber supply chains. Also, in some cases, a shared responsibly model which clearly defines the responsibilities of suppliers and their customers can be highly beneficial.

                        In sourcing applications, ICT equipment and services, an organisation should use trusted suppliers that they have previously vetted as part of cyber supply chain risk management assessments and subsequently recorded on their approved supplier list.

                        Furthermore, in order to support system availability, an organisation should aim to identify multiple potential suppliers for critical applications, ICT equipment and services. This coupled with keeping sufficient spares of critical ICT equipment in reserve, can assist in mitigating the impact of cyber supply chain disruptions.

                        As part of the delivery of applications, ICT equipment and services, measures should be implemented to protect their integrity, noting that such measures will differ depending on whether delivery relates to digital or physical distribution channels. For example, applications may benefit from delivery via encrypted communication channels while ICT equipment may benefit from tracking and tamper-evident packaging. In doing so, such measures are only beneficial if they are assessed as part of acceptance of products and services. In all cases, suppliers should be consulted on how best to confirm the integrity of their products and services.

                        While ensuring the integrity of applications, ICT equipment and services is important, so is ensuring their authenticity. For example, a counterfeit product or service securely delivered is still a counterfeit product or service that may not operate as intended or pose a risk to the security of a system. To assist in identifying counterfeit products and services, suppliers should be consulted on how best to confirm the authenticity of their products and services.

                        Obligations for protecting data are no different when using a managed service or cloud service than when using an in-house service. As such, contractual arrangements with service providers should address how data entrusted to them, including to any of their subcontractors, will be protected both during contractual arrangements and following the completion or termination of contractual arrangements. However, in some cases an organisation may require managed services or cloud services to be used before all security requirements have been implemented by a service provider. In such cases, contractual arrangements with service providers should include appropriate timeframes for the implementation of security requirements and break clauses if these are not achieved.

                        In addition, although data ownership resides with service providersâ€™ customers, this can become less clear in some circumstances, such as when legal action is taken and a service provider is asked to provide access to, or data from, their assets. To mitigate the likelihood of data being unavailable or compromised, an organisation can document the types of data and its ownership in contractual arrangements with service providers.

                        Furthermore, an organisation may make the decision to move from their current service provider for strategic, operational or governance reasons. This may involve changing to another service provider, moving to a different service with the same service provider or moving back to an on-premises solution. In many cases, transferring data and functionality between old and new services or systems will be desired. Service providers can assist their customers by ensuring data is as portable as possible and that as much data can be exported as possible. As such, data should be stored in a documented format, preferably an open standard, noting that undocumented or proprietary formats may make it more difficult for an organisation to perform backup, service migration or service decommissioning activities.

                        Finally, to ensure that an organisation is given sufficient time to download their data or move to another service provider should a service provider cease offering a particular service, a one month notification period should be documented in contractual arrangements with service providers.

However, without proper controls in place, this could leave systems and data vulnerable â€“ especially when access occurs from outside of Australian borders. As such, an organisation should ensure that their systems and data are not accessed or administered by service providers unless such requirements, and associated measures to control such requirements, are documented in contractual arrangements with service providers. In doing so, it is important that sufficient measures are also in place to detect and record any unauthorised access, such as customer support representatives or platform engineers accessing encryption keys. In such cases, the service provider should immediately report the cyber security incident to their customer and make available all logs pertaining to the unauthorised access.
