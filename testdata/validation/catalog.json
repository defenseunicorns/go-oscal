In all cases, assessors should hold an appropriate security clearance and have an appropriate level of experience and understanding of the type of system they are assessing.\n\nAt the conclusion of a security assessment, a security assessment report should be produced outlining the scope of the security assessment, the systemâ€™s strengths and weaknesses, security risks associated with the operation of the system, the effectiveness of the implementation of controls, and any recommended remediation actions.

In doing so, specific events may necessitate additional risk management activities. Such events may include:\n\n- changes in security policies relating to the system\n- detection of new or emerging cyber threats to the system or its operating environment\n- the discovery that controls for the system are not as effective as planned\n- a major cyber security incident involving the system\n- major architectural changes to the system.\n\nFollowing the implementation or modification of any controls as a result of risk management activities, another security assessment should be completed. In doing so, the systemâ€™s authorisation package should be updated. This in turn allows the authorising officer to make an informed risk-based decision as to whether the security risks associated with the systemâ€™s operation are still acceptable. Should security risks no longer be acceptable, the authorising officer may choose to either place constraints on the systemâ€™s use, such as introducing or amending an expiration date for authorisation to operate, or revoke authorisation to operate altogether."
